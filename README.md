Genetic algorithm library to solve non-linear optimization problems.

Compile with:
gcc -o executable \*.c -lm

Run (1000 generations):
chmod a+x executable
./executable 1000

Define your own function to be otpimized:
Change the files sail.h and sail.c

Future work:

1.  Use a callback function for the optimization-cost-function.
2.  Parallel processing using distributed populations.
